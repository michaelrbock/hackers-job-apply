=================

Reduce the spam you get for your job posting by setting up a micro challenge. 

Companies very often include emails on the job page. As a result, you have to browse through spam from recruiters
and incompetent people. To filter them out set up a tiny task. Here is an example:

```
What is the largest 3 digit prime number?
POST JSON to the server with the answer -> { "answer": "xxx" }
```

## How to use it?

1. Use heroku deploy button (requires Heroku account).  

[![Deploy to Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

1. Change JOB_EMAIL to yours. Change ANSWER and QUESTION if you want to use different challenge.

## Different challenges

1. [Euler project](https://projecteuler.net/problems) is a great source of problems
1. base64 solution
1. [Something more fancy](https://trello.com/jobs/developer)  

## Deploying to Heroku (command line)
